# Background

As I'm trying to look for a data analyst job, I want to look into how is the job market now specifically in USA. The dataset is from kaggle "Business Analyst Job Listings 2024".

# Purpose of the project

This project aims to provide the most useful information job seekers in terms of profability.

# Tools I used

I used Excel only, specifically power query and pivot table. I did 90% of the data cleaning in power query from splitting up long text to changing the salary display. 
Technique included but not limited to replace value, adding custom column, spliting then pivoting...etc.

# End result

# Conclusion
- Entertainment industry seems to pay the highest among all the industries so that could be something job seekers look into.
- While the gap between the top paying states are rather huge, it's worth noting that remote jobs pay quite decent comparing to most regions, that means it's a great chance for those that are living in relatively low paying are can still find a better paying job.
- There's not much difference between the top paying companies so it could be a minor factor when job searching.
- The dataset only includes two-month of job posting date, we can see that November has way more job posting volume so it would be a great time for jub hunting.
